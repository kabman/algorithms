Translate the following sentences from English to predicate logic. The domain
that you are working over is X, the set of people. You may use the functions
S(x), meaning that “x has been a student of 6.042,” A(x), meaning that “x has
gotten an ‘A’ in 6.042,” T(x), meaning that “x is a TA of 6.042,” and E(x, y),
meaning that “x and y are the same person.”

## a

There are people who have taken 6.042 and have gotten A’s in 6.042

    ∃ x, y ∈ X. S(x) ∧ S(y) ∧ A(x) ∧ A(y)

## b

All people who are 6.042 TA’s and have taken 6.042 got A’s in 6.042

    ∀ x ∈ X. (T(x) ∧ S(x)) ⇒ A(x))

See http://math.stackexchange.com/q/2083390/399542. I think the outer
parentheses are redundant, so 

    ∀ x ∈ X. T(x) ∧ S(x)) ⇒ A(x)

is equivalent, i.e the quantifier operates on everything until the next period.

e.g. Goldbach's conjecture can be written as

    ∀ n ∈ N. (n ∈ Evens) ⇒ (∃p, q ∈ Primes. p + q = n)

The scope of the first quantifier is the entire proposition.

## c

There are no people who are 6.042 TA’s who did not get A’s in 6.042

    ¬(∃ x ∈ X. T(x) ∧ ¬A(x))

("it is not true that: there is a person who is a TA and who didn't get an A")

which (by the rules of negating quantifiers) is equivalent to

    ∀ x ∈ X. ¬(T(x) ∧ ¬A(x))

("all people did not: TA and get an A")

## d

There are at least three people who are TA’s in 6.042 and have not taken 6.042

    ∃ x, y, z ∈ X. T(x) ∧ T(y) ∧ T(z) ∧ ¬S(x) ∧ ¬S(y) ∧ ¬S(z) ∧ ¬E(x, y) ∧ ¬E(x, z) ∧ ¬E(y, z)

Note: if this question had been "there are exactly three people" it would have
been a little tougher. 

One way to do it would have been to add

    ∧ (∀ w ∈ X. T(w) ∧ ¬(w) ⇒ (w = x ∨ w = y ∨ w = z))

i.e. if w is a person for whom the conditions are true, then w is either x or y
or z. See http://math.stackexchange.com/q/962829/399542.

Skip.

# 3

## a

By comparison of truth tables

    (A ∧ B) ⇔ ¬(A nand B)

    (A ∨ B) ⇔ (¬A nand ¬B)

    (A ⇒ B) ⇔ (A nand ¬B)

## b

    ¬A ⇔ (A nand A)

## c

    True ⇔ (A nand ¬A) ⇔ (A nand (A nand A))

    False ⇔ (A nand (A nand A)) nand (A nand (A nand A))

Binary search narrows down light coin to one of 6 with first weigh, then 3,
then 1.

Prove that if r is irrational then r^(1/5) is also irrational.

Proof. We prove the contrapositive: if r^(1/5) is rational then r is also
rational.

If r^(1/5) is rational then r^(1/5) = a/b where a and b are integers.

Then r = a^5/b^5. Both a^5 and b^5 are integers, therefore r is rational. QED.

## Lemma 1. (∀ n ∈ ℕ. n is even) ⇔ (∃ a ∈ ℕ. n^2 = 4a)

_Proof_. Prove n is even implies n^2 = 4a and vice versa.

 1. If n is even then n = 2i, where i is an integer.
 
    n^2 = (2i) * (2i) = 4i^2 = 4a, where a is some integer.

 2. If n^2 = 4a then n^2 is even. The product of two odd numbers is odd, so n
    must be even.

QED.

## Lemma 2. (∀ n ∈ ℕ. n is odd) ⇔ (∃ a ∈ ℕ. n^2 = 4a + 1)

_Proof_. Prove n is odd implies n^2 = 4a + 1 and vice versa.

 1. If n is even then n = 2i, where i is an integer.
 
    n^2 = (2i) * (2i) = 4i^2 = 4a, where a is some integer.

 2. If n^2 = 4a + 1 then n^2 is odd. The product of two even numbers is even,
    so n must be odd.

QED.

## Corollary.

The square of any integer is either a multiple of 4, or a multiple of 4 plus 1.

Now, Suppose w^2 + x^2 + y^2 = z^2 where w, x, y and z are positive integers. 

## Theorem. z is even iff w, x and y are even.

_Proof_. This proof is by case analysis. 

The cases are:

 1. w, x and y are all even

    z^2 = 4a + 4b + 4c where a, b, c ∈ ℕ (by lemma 1). z^2 is a multiple of 4.
    Therefore z is even (by lemma 1).

 3. one of w, x and y are odd

    z^2 = 4a + 4b + 4c + 1 where a, b, c ∈ ℕ (by lemmas 1 and 2). z^2 is
    1 greater than a multiple of 4. Therefore z is odd (by lemma 2).

 3. two of w, x and y are odd

    z^2 = 4a + 4b + 4c + 2 where a, b, c ∈ ℕ (by lemma 1 and 2). z^2 is 2
    greater than a multiple of 4. Therefore z is not an integer by the
    corollary.

 2. w, x and y are all odd

    z^2 = 4a + 4b + 4c + 3 where a, b, c ∈ ℕ (by lemma 1 and 2). z^2 is 3
    greater than a multiple of 4. Therefore z is not an integer by the
    corollary.

The only case that implies that z is even is when w, x and y are all even. QED.
