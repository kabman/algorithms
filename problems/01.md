Translate the following sentences from English to predicate logic. The domain
that you are working over is X, the set of people. You may use the functions
S(x), meaning that “x has been a student of 6.042,” A(x), meaning that “x has
gotten an ‘A’ in 6.042,” T(x), meaning that “x is a TA of 6.042,” and E(x, y),
meaning that “x and y are the same person.”

## a

There are people who have taken 6.042 and have gotten A’s in 6.042

    ∃ x, y ∈ X. S(x) ∧ S(y) ∧ A(x) ∧ A(y)

## b

All people who are 6.042 TA’s and have taken 6.042 got A’s in 6.042

    (∀ x ∈ X. T(x) ∧ S(x)) ⇒ A(x)

Note this is saying that if the hypothesis is true for a particular x then so
is the conclusion. Neither the English sentence nor the predicate logic makes
any claims about whether the hypothesis is in fact true (i.e. whether any TA's
who took 6.042 exist).

## c

There are no people who are 6.042 TA’s who did not get A’s in 6.042

    ¬(∃ x ∈ X. T(x) ∧ ¬A(x))

("it is not true that: there is a person who is a TA and who didn't get an A")

which (by the rules of negating quantifiers) is equivalent to

    ∀ x ∈ X. ¬(T(x) ∧ ¬A(x))

("all people did not: TA and get an A")

## d

There are at least three people who are TA’s in 6.042 and have not taken 6.042

    ∃ x, y, z ∈ X. T(x) ∧ T(y) ∧ T(z) ∧ ¬S(x) ∧ ¬S(y) ∧ ¬S(z)
