Translate the following sentences from English to predicate logic. The domain
that you are working over is X, the set of people. You may use the functions
S(x), meaning that “x has been a student of 6.042,” A(x), meaning that “x has
gotten an ‘A’ in 6.042,” T(x), meaning that “x is a TA of 6.042,” and E(x, y),
meaning that “x and y are the same person.”

## a

There are people who have taken 6.042 and have gotten A’s in 6.042

    ∃ x, y ∈ X. S(x) ∧ S(y) ∧ A(x) ∧ A(y)

## b

All people who are 6.042 TA’s and have taken 6.042 got A’s in 6.042

    ∀ x ∈ X. (T(x) ∧ S(x)) ⇒ A(x))

See http://math.stackexchange.com/q/2083390/399542. I think the outer
parentheses are redundant, so 

    ∀ x ∈ X. T(x) ∧ S(x)) ⇒ A(x)

is equivalent, i.e the quantifier operates on everything until the next period.

e.g. Goldbach's conjecture can be written as

    ∀ n ∈ N. (n ∈ Evens) ⇒ (∃p, q ∈ Primes. p + q = n)

The scope of the first quantifier is the entire proposition.

## c

There are no people who are 6.042 TA’s who did not get A’s in 6.042

    ¬(∃ x ∈ X. T(x) ∧ ¬A(x))

("it is not true that: there is a person who is a TA and who didn't get an A")

which (by the rules of negating quantifiers) is equivalent to

    ∀ x ∈ X. ¬(T(x) ∧ ¬A(x))

("all people did not: TA and get an A")

## d

There are at least three people who are TA’s in 6.042 and have not taken 6.042

    ∃ x, y, z ∈ X. T(x) ∧ T(y) ∧ T(z) ∧ ¬S(x) ∧ ¬S(y) ∧ ¬S(z) ∧ ¬E(x, y) ∧ ¬E(x, z) ∧ ¬E(y, z)

# 2

Skip.

# 3

## a

By comparison of truth tables

    (A ∧ B) ⇔ ¬(A nand B)

    (A ∨ B) ⇔ (¬A nand ¬B)

    (A ⇒ B) ⇔ (A nand ¬B)

## b

    ¬A ⇔ (A nand A)

## c

    True ⇔ (A nand ¬A) ⇔ (A nand (A nand A))

    False ⇔ (A nand (A nand A)) nand (A nand (A nand A))
