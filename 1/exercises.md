# BPV Chapter 1

## 1.1

_Theorem_. In any base the sum of three one digit numbers is at most a 2 digit
number.

A 1-digit number in base b is at most b - 1. The sum of three of them is at
most 3b - 3.

The maximum value that can be represented in a 2-digit number in base b is
b^2 - 1.

âˆ€ b >= 2, b^2 - 1 >= 3b - 3. QED.
